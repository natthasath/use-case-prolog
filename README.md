### üèÜ Run

- Open SWI Prolog

```shell
swipl
```

- Run `hello.pl`

```
1 ?- [hello].
true.

2 ?- parent(X, mary).
X = john.

3 ?- grandparent(john, Y).
Y = kate ;
```

- Run `game24.pl`

```
1 ?- [game24].
true.

2 ?- solve24(4, 8, 3, 1, Expr).
Expr = (4+8)*(3-1) ;
Expr = (8+4)*(3-1) ;
Expr = (3-1)*(4+8) ;
Expr = (3-1)*(8+4) ;
false.
```

- Run `prime_factor.pl`

```
1 ?- [prime_factor].
true.

2 ?- prime_factors(84, Factors).
Factors = [7, 3, 2, 2] .

3 ?- prime_factors(101, Factors). 
Factors = [101] .
